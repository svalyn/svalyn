= Svalyn

Svalyn is a simple side-project allowing me to test some code related to web technologies.
This project has no precise goals, do not expect anything from it.

== Build and start

- `./build.sh` to build both the frontend and the backend
- `docker-compose up -d --build` to start the test instance
- `cd frontend && npm run-script e2e-prod` to run the integration tests against the test instance
